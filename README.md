#### Your Cloud of Choice

We run Fontbakery Dashboard on the Google Cloud and for development on Minikube, but it really is your choice where to host your dashboard.
Kubernetes is supported by many more providers (like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, etc) and you can learn more about this in the [kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution).
