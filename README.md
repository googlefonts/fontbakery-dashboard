Font Bakery-Dashboard was a web application to make [Font Bakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery) (a command-line font project checker) available easily to everyone.

A Live Demo used to be hosted at fontbakery.graphicore.de but it is no longer available.

The project was halted at the end of 2019.

#### Your Cloud of Choice

We ran Fontbakery Dashboard on the Google Cloud and for development on Minikube, but it really is your choice where to host your dashboard.
Kubernetes is supported by many more providers (like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, etc) and you can learn more about this in the [kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution).
