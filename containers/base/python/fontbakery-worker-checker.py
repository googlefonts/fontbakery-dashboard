    FIXME: when all jobs are finished, we need a worker that
    is cleaning up ... that could be part of the dispatch-worker/manifest-master
    initiating and cleaning up would make some sense there...

    We need this especially to purge the cacheKey when not used anymore
    but also to eventually set the correct "finished" date and flag to
    the family/collection job.

    THUS: this would dispatch a queue message, that it has finished this
          job when _run ran to the end (when it fails the job won't be
          acked and will re-run)
    The dispatch worker would A) mark the whole test document as `finished`
    and, if part of a collection test, dispatch another queue message for
    the manifest master (sociopath) to clean up and mark as finished the
    test document.

    TODO here: postmortem messages
      - as sender:  basically the same for checker-worker to dispatcher-cleanup
                                    and for dispatcher-cleanup to manifest-master-cleanup
      - as receiver for: dispatcher-worker from many checker-workers
                      and manifest-sociopath from many dispatcher-worker
      - the manifest-sociopath could be implemented here. CAUTION: the
                      worker that dispatches collection-tests is meant here
                      needs better role description!
                      ALSO, how does a drag and drop job enter the process?
                      someone has to dispatch to a dispatcher-worker and
                      clean up it's answer!
    good case:
      The finishedMessage is queued for each checker worker that's not
      in pod restart back-off loop i.e. where _run could write `finished`
      to a job.

      assert finishedMessage.jobid has a finished field
                    OR set it yourself and put a warning message there.
                    "Did not finish itself, this should be highly irregular."

      Eventually all checker workers have a `finished` field.
      Then (all not in a particular order)
          * the family test can write it's `finished` field
          * if it has a collectionTest, dispatch a finishedMessage for that
          * purge the cache
      Then ack the queue message

    bad case:
      some/one worker checkers don't ever emit the finishedMessage
      The worst thing here is that the cache will keep the data forever
      so maybe we can add a mechanism to eventually end a job and purge
      all caches. It's not so bad when we don't get the appropriate finished
      fields set, but that would be done in the same run.
