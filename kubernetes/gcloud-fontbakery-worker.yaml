# eventually we'll have a cheap way to scale and wait in the same nodepool,
# but not this year.
# Also, we could use a priority queue for drag and drop jobs, to serve
# faster while a family-wide check runs. RabbitMq implements priority queues.
# https://www.rabbitmq.com/priority.html
# 110 is the upper limit for pods, so we can use it all
# For a standard machine 64CPU 240GB VM:
# 0.58 * 110 = 63.8
# cpu: 580m
# but, actually there seems no improvement in speed over 200m
# Thus, a smaller machine, but with ~ 220 GB (seems needed)
# But it's probably less.
# For a custom machine 34CPU 221GB (the smallest with this amount of RAM)
# cpu: 300m
# To actually be able to scale to ~ 2.5 k, we need to respect
# our quota of 500 CPUs, thus after subtracting our 16 CPU
# infrastructure VM we have 484 CPUs left, with 0.2 per pod
# we're at 22 CPU machines, max ram is 143 GB here,
# let's hope its enough.
# cpu: 200m
# ALWAYS CHOOSE:
# Preemtible: enabled! (much cheaper, our use case)
# Use 1 SSD, try 170 GB, if it doesn't cause disk pressure
# we should be able to scale up to ~22 VMS and ~ 2.5 k workers
# 5 VMS: 519 Pods
